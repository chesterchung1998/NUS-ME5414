# NUS-ME5414
A detailed optimization project which studies different optimization techniques in solving dynamical problems. The two algorithms involved in the study are the SeDuMi (Self-Dual Minimization) algorithm and the MOSEK algorithm. Factors such as computational time, memory usage, and sensitivity to tolerance are analyzed to make a conclusion on which algorithm is more suited for specific types of problems (convex optimization problems, mixed-integer optimization problems etc.)
